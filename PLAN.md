# KRN Active Plan

Status: active compact root plan.

Date: 2026-06-27.

Repository: `/home/krn/coding/krn/active/mise-en-palace`.

Root `PLAN.md` is the compact product single source of truth. Detailed
continuous execution lives in:

```txt
PLANS.md
```

Do not create another parallel roadmap.

## Current Product State

Current readiness:

```txt

product-ready: no
widened internal alpha: no
V02-01 real second-operator proof: blocked/deferred
active stream: V43 Target Stability Window Gate
current task: V43-00 Target Stability Window Gate
```

## Active Stream

### V43-00 — Target Stability Window Gate

Goal:

Decide the next target work only after a stable clean target window, explicit
dirty-state permission, real second-operator input, or switch back to KRN
internal source hardening.

Current finding:

```txt
V42 found `wilq-seo` dirty again at task start. Elektroinstal remains blocked
by unresolved patch lifecycle. Active target repos are too volatile for another
target trial without a stability window or explicit permission.
```

Current V43 action:

```txt
Re-gate target stability and choose either a stable target protocol, target
owner request, V02-01 input wait, or KRN internal hardening direction.
```

## V02-01 Boundary

V02-01 can resume only with real second-operator inputs:

```txt
operator:
KRN source:
target repo:
DB mode:
support boundary:
operator transcript:
```

Do not substitute self/headless scenarios for V02-01.

## Hard Non-Goals

Do not build or claim:

- fake V02-01 proof;
- product-ready status;
- widened internal alpha;
- dashboard;
- API server;
- MCP server;
- worker daemon;
- source crawler;
- Research Foundry;
- broad eval platform;
- generic multi-agent system;
- runtime markdown memory;
- hidden semantic hooks;
- living target repo writes without explicit scope;
- large `AGENTS.md` expansion;
- parallel roadmap.

## Verification Policy

Use the narrowest relevant verification for each slice.

Docs/plan-only changes:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Source changes:

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
git diff --check
```

DB/eval-affecting changes:

```sh
pnpm db:ready
pnpm db:smoke
pnpm eval:promptfoo:smoke
```

After each bounded slice, commit, push, and confirm CI when appropriate.
