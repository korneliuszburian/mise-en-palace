# KRN Active Plan

Status: active compact root plan. Date: 2026-06-30.

Root `PLAN.md` is the compact product source of truth. Detailed history stays in `PLANS.md`.
Current-task contracts live in `PLANS.md`.

## Product State

```txt
controlled-internal-alpha for technical operators: yes / stronger
product-ready: no
widened internal alpha: no
V02-01 real second-operator proof: blocked/deferred
active stream: V373 Heartbeat Runtime Candidate Review Result
current task: V373-00 Review One Heartbeat Runtime Candidate Result
```

## Compact Checkpoints

```txt
repo/current-truth hygiene: strong enough for continuation
evidence/review loop: DB-backed and useful for dogfood
candidate reviewability: core primitive
source-search readback: usable through CLI and JSON
brain-search preview: usable through CLI and JSON
product loop replay: DB-backed and inspectable
graph-brain readback: relation summary visible through source/brain search
ingest v0/v1: bounded loop readback visible through source artifact preview
heartbeat/dreaming: manual candidate-only runtime loop readback visible through heartbeat preview
product-ready brain: not complete
```

## Active Task

### V373-00 Review One Heartbeat Runtime Candidate Result

Status: active.

Goal: use the V372 manual heartbeat runtime-loop readback to review one
maintenance candidate and capture result/evidence without mutating final truth
automatically.

Hard boundary: no scheduler, daemon, crawler, dashboard, API server, MCP
server, schema rewrite, broad benchmark, worker runtime, autonomous Memory Core
mutation, or generic multi-agent runtime.

## Recent Completed Streams

```txt
V358: graph query-shape diagnostics closure.
V359-V360: Fallow quality gate and bounded legacy cleanup; full Fallow clean.
V361: source-search JSON answer packages expose read-only relationSupport.
V362: second local artifact ingest/readback and source chunk receiver fix.
V363: candidate-only brain heartbeat preview primitive.
V364: heartbeat preview CLI/readback.
V365: heartbeat preview review/eval closure.
V366: heartbeat preview golden behavior proof.
V367: consensus eval/candidate lane completion audit.
V368: brain search product surface preview.
V369: end-to-end product loop replay.
V370: graph brain v1 readback.
V371: ingest v0/v1 bounded input loop readback.
V372: heartbeat/dreaming manual candidate runtime-loop readback.
```

## Remaining Product Gaps

```txt
1. heartbeat runtime candidate review result
2. pattern/research brain
3. real benchmarks
4. second-operator proof
5. product UI/API/MCP after usefulness/security gates
```

## Pattern Gate

For non-trivial infra, harness, CI/eval, Codex-surface, TypeScript,
target-workflow, security, operator-UX, or research/paper/course-driven work:

```txt
source -> mechanism -> KRN implication -> decision/rejection -> consumer -> falsifier
```

## Verification Policy

Use the narrowest relevant verification.

```txt
docs/plan-only: git diff --check
source: pnpm typecheck, pnpm test, git diff --check
DB/eval-affecting: pnpm db:ready, pnpm db:smoke, pnpm eval:promptfoo:smoke when relevant
```

If Vitest hits a temporary-directory write error, use
`TMPDIR=/home/krn/.cache/krn-tmp pnpm test`. Do not set `TMPDIR` under the repo checkout:
CLI boundary tests rely on outside-workspace temporary directories.

After each bounded slice, commit, push, and confirm CI with the full SHA.
