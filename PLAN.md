# KRN Active Plan

Status: active compact root plan. Date: 2026-06-30.

Root `PLAN.md` is the compact product source of truth. Detailed history stays in `PLANS.md`.
Current-task contracts live in `PLANS.md`.

## Product State

```txt
controlled-internal-alpha for technical operators: yes / stronger
product-ready: no
widened internal alpha: no
V02-01 real second-operator proof: blocked/deferred
active stream: V375 Pattern Research Brain Intake Trial
current task: V375-00 Pattern Research Brain Intake Trial
```

## Compact Checkpoints

```txt
repo/current-truth hygiene: strong enough for continuation
evidence/review loop: DB-backed and useful for dogfood
candidate reviewability: core primitive
source-search readback: usable through CLI and JSON
brain-search preview: usable through CLI and JSON
product loop replay: DB-backed and inspectable
graph-brain readback: relation summary visible through source/brain search
ingest v0/v1: bounded loop readback visible through source artifact preview
heartbeat/dreaming: manual candidate-only runtime loop readback visible through heartbeat preview
heartbeat candidate review: one candidate can be reviewed/deferred with evidence result
source relation candidate evidence: missing relation evidence is explicit and blocks review-ready status
product-ready brain: not complete
```

## Active Task

### V375-00 Pattern Research Brain Intake Trial

Status: active.

Goal: run one bounded pattern/research intake through source -> mechanism ->
KRN implication -> decision/rejection -> consumer -> falsifier -> eval/candidate.

Hard boundary: no scheduler, daemon, crawler, dashboard, API server, MCP
server, schema rewrite, broad benchmark, worker runtime, autonomous Memory Core
mutation, source-truth mutation, or generic multi-agent runtime.

```

## Remaining Product Gaps

```txt
1. pattern/research brain
2. real benchmarks
3. second-operator proof
4. product UI/API/MCP after usefulness/security gates
```

## Pattern Gate

For non-trivial infra, harness, CI/eval, Codex-surface, TypeScript,
target-workflow, security, operator-UX, or research/paper/course-driven work:

```txt
source -> mechanism -> KRN implication -> decision/rejection -> consumer -> falsifier
```

## Verification Policy

Use the narrowest relevant verification.

```txt
docs/plan-only: git diff --check
source: pnpm typecheck, pnpm test, git diff --check
DB/eval-affecting: pnpm db:ready, pnpm db:smoke, pnpm eval:promptfoo:smoke when relevant
```

If Vitest hits a temporary-directory write error, use
`TMPDIR=/home/krn/.cache/krn-tmp pnpm test`. Do not set `TMPDIR` under the repo checkout:
CLI boundary tests rely on outside-workspace temporary directories.

After each bounded slice, commit, push, and confirm CI with the full SHA.
