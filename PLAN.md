# KRN Active Plan

Status: active compact root plan.

Date: 2026-06-27.

Repository: `/home/krn/coding/krn/active/mise-en-palace`.

Root `PLAN.md` is the compact product single source of truth. Detailed
continuous execution lives in:

```txt
PLANS.md
```

Do not create another parallel roadmap.

## Current Product State

Current readiness:

```txt

widened internal alpha: no
V02-01 real second-operator proof: blocked/deferred

## Active Stream

### V42-00 — WILQ Fresh Observation-Only Baseline Retry

Goal:

Retry WILQ observation-only baseline with fresh target status at task start.

Current finding:

```txt
V41 found `wilq-seo` is clean again, while `krn-elektroinstal-ogar` remains
blocked by handed-off unresolved patch state. WILQ can be retried only with a
fresh status check at V42 start.
```

Current V42 action:

```txt
Re-run WILQ status, then complete observation-only baseline or stop if WILQ is
dirty again.
```

## V02-01 Boundary

V02-01 can resume only with real second-operator inputs:

```txt
operator:
KRN source:
target repo:
DB mode:
support boundary:
operator transcript:
```

Do not substitute self/headless scenarios for V02-01.

## Hard Non-Goals

Do not build or claim:

- fake V02-01 proof;
- product-ready status;
- widened internal alpha;
- dashboard;
- API server;
- MCP server;
- worker daemon;
- source crawler;
- Research Foundry;
- broad eval platform;
- generic multi-agent system;
- runtime markdown memory;
- hidden semantic hooks;
- living target repo writes without explicit scope;
- large `AGENTS.md` expansion;
- parallel roadmap.

## Verification Policy

Use the narrowest relevant verification for each slice.

Docs/plan-only changes:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Source changes:

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
git diff --check
```

DB/eval-affecting changes:

```sh
pnpm db:ready
pnpm db:smoke
pnpm eval:promptfoo:smoke
```

After each bounded slice, commit, push, and confirm CI when appropriate.
